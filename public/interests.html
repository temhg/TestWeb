        <h2>My interests include:</h2>
        <h3 id="shift-down">Space</h3>
        <p>I enjoy following what's going on in the space industry, such as rocketry, in-space manufacturing and other
            mission types.</p>

        <h3>Building things</h3>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy building and dissecting mechanisms to figure out how they work.</p>

        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <p>I am interested in their inner workings and performance, often spending time gaining knowledge through platforms like YouTube.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>I mostly play creative games such as Scrap Mechanic and Minecraft.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I enjoy listening to most popular genres of music, and used to play multiple instruments.</p>
